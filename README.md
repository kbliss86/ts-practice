# TypeScript Practice Lab

## Objective: TypeScript Functions

This lab consists of three parts to give you ample TypeScript practice. You will be working with TypeScript interfaces, functions, and arrays. Complete all tasks in a single TypeScript (.ts) file.

### Instructions

1. **Tallest Mountain**
   - Create an interface called `Mountain` with properties `name` (string) and `height` (number).
   - Declare an array called `mountains` containing a list of mountains.
   - Write a function `findNameOfTallestMountain` that takes an array of mountains and returns the name of the tallest mountain.
   - Call the function and print the result.

2. **Products**
   - Create an interface called `Product` with properties `name` (string) and `price` (number).
   - Declare an array called `products` containing a list of products.
   - Write a function `calcAverageProductPrice` that takes an array of products and returns the average price.
   - Call the function and print the result.

3. **Inventory**
   - Create an interface called `InventoryItem` with properties `product` (of type `Product`) and `quantity` (number).
   - Declare an array called `inventory` containing a list of inventory items.
   - Write a function `calcInventoryValue` that takes an array of inventory items and returns the total inventory value.
   - Call the function and print the result.
